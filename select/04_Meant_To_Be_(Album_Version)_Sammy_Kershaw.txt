Well first I missed my plane
So I wound up on your flight
Then we got stuck in Dallas-Ft. Worth half the night
And the only vacant seat you could find at gate twenty-nine
Was one next to mine

Call it fate, destiny, call it luck you ended up with me
But some things are meant to be
Coincidence, circumstance or something bigger that's just out of our hands
Oh, some things are meant to be

You said Atlanta was your home
Well I happened to live there too
I'd just broken up with someone and so had you
And when you said for everyone there is someone they're meant to find
I knew I'd found mine

Call it fate, destiny, call it luck you ended up with me
But some things are meant to be
Coincidence, circumstance or something bigger that's just out of our hands
Oh, some things are meant to be

Coincidence, circumstance or something bigger that's just out of our hands
Oh, some things are meant to be
Baby some things are meant to be
