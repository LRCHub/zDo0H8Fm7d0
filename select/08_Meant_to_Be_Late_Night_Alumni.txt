At 2am
I'm driving home from being with you
Playing back our favourite song
Turn it up
Wonder if you're listening to
Know it's late but I gotta call

Cos I know
You'll be there
Whenever I'm hurting
Whenever I fall

And the love that we share
Did it happen by chance
Or was there something more?

Cos you and I were meant to be
It maybe was our destiny
Staying together
Is a certainty
Like the sun and the rain
Like the night and the day
We were meant to be

2am and I'm still thinking of you
I can't get you off my mind
When you call to say you're missing me too
Wish that you were here tonight

Do you know
I'll be there
Whenever you're hurting
Whenever you fall

And the love that we share
Did it happen by chance
Or was there something more?

Cos you and I were meant to be
It maybe was our destiny
Staying together
Is a certainty
Like the sun and the rain
Like the night and the day
We were meant to be

I remember
When I first laid eyes on you
I knew you were the one for me

I knew you were the one
I don't know how to explain it
But it's plain to see

That you and I were meant to be
It maybe was our destiny
Staying together
Is a certainty
Like the sun and the rain
Like the night and the day

You and I were meant to be
It maybe was our destiny
Staying together
Is a certainty
Like the sun and the rain
Like the night and the day

You and I were meant to be
It maybe was our destiny
Staying together
Is a certainty
Like the sun and the rain
Like the night and the day
We were meant to be
